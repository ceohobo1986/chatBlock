1.27
Implemented the "search" function. Messages will be searched from newer to older (from bottom to top). If a matched message is not found in the currently loaded chat messages then the "search" request will be sent to the server.As Chatcube messages are encrypted in the database then in the big chat groups it can take some time to find a message because it needs to decrypt every message. The search in the Telegram is using the Telegram search API.The server will send back the first found message with some older and newer message around the found message. The server will not search for all messages and does not count of possible found messages as it can take much more time. There are the arrows "up" and "down" in the interface which move to next or previous found message, the keyboard keys "up"/"down" can be used also. If no more messages are found then alert "Messages not found" will be displayed.Current found message marked by different color and found substring also marked by yellow background in all displayed messages (not only in currently found).The messages filters "Messages with links","Messages with emails","Photos and Files" moved from the main toolbar to the search toolbar and become part of search. You can leave the input search text empty and select only filter or can enter the search text and then it will find messages by filter which MUST INCLUDE search text.The "search mode" is activated by click on the search icon at the right side of the main input toolbar.
Implemented button "go bottom" with down arrow icon which will scroll the history to the bottom. As RISCOS does not allow non-rectangular windows then the button subwindow is rectangular... I tried to set the transparent background color but it does not work as expected.When you have a chat group with many unread messages then it will load only first unread messages instead going to the end of history. You can scroll down manually and chat will load more newer messages automatically, the same as when you scroll up. The button with down arrow can be used to go to the end of chat history.
Implemented "Delete my account" option. The button is located in the "Choices"->"Chatcube chat"
Implemented ability to drag text from other applications to Chatcube to paste in the input line (tested with NetSurf). Fixed bug with "<Wimp$Scrap>" handling and crashing Chatcube after drag link from NetSurf to Chatcube.
Implemented "Download history" option. Option located in the chat menu. It will download the whole chat history to your computer in the HTML format. Files and photos are not downloaded but HTML output have links pointed to the server. This function works only for ChatCube chats because for Telegram we do not store the history on the server. 
Attempt to fix the "Input focus window not found" error.

1.26
Fixed bug with empty "last message" in the chats list.
Fixed bug with handling of the "start hidden" option.

Needs to bring window to front manually before take screenshoot.
Fixed problem when messages scrolled up and "unread" counter not incremented on new incoming message.
Download images and save to downloads when select the "Download" message's menu item. Open image via "Filer_Run" on double-click. Previously images always opened via "Filer_Run"

Implemented Reply function. Reply called from the message menu. In the Reply mode some additional info will be displayed: member's name, part of original message (on blue background) and Cancel reply button.
Implement display of replies and forwarded messages similar way as in Telegram. 
Implemented autoresizing TextArea as input message control. Message sent by Enter key as before, if you need to insert new line then use Ctrl-Enter or Shift-Enter. New input control may be a little buggy because TextArea does not provide useful info about internals and some hacks used to detect required gadget size. Hope it will work well. Known issue: when you erase some text then the area will not shrink automatically. It will shrink only when the message is completely erased (empty).
Implemented automatic Inactive member's status. Yellow circle instead of green used for indication of this mode. Inactive status means member have running chat and online but not send any requests and the last request was sent more than 4 minute ago.
Implemented scroll to first unread message instead scrolling to the end of history when opening a chat. Note: loaded up to 100 last unread messages. If you have more unread messages then chat will load only 100 latest and previous messages will be marked as "read". This limit should prevent a ban of our server by Telegram (due too many requests) and reduce load on the server.
Fixed hourglass when the chat window is hidden, in this case hourglass will hide and not display.

1.19

Changed sort ordering of the "Online" sort mode. Sort by "Online" then by "Last message" then by "Chat title"

1.16
Implemented forward messages between different messengers. If a message forwarded to the same messengers then used an internal messenger's "forward" function. If a message forwarded to different messengers them message content copied and only messages of types text, photo, file can be forwarded this way, stickers or other message types can't be forwarded between different messengers.
Fix for Wimp sprites bug. Icons which used in the Iconbar seems must be present in the system aprite area. Put all icons used in the IconBar to the !Sprite which is then loaded with IconSprites command.

1.15
Fix Wimp sprite area. Do load only a single app icon into the Wimp sprite area using IconSprites command. All other app sprites moved to Sprites and loaded into the application sprite area.
